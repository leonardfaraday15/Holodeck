HOLODECK VERSION 0.1

This is a repository of blends for Blender, the open source modeling tool. It also includes files which would be of use along with Blender. More information can be found at 
https://www.blender.org/

I'm going to attempt to document the contents of this repository in such a way to to help people who are learning to use Blender. Please let me know if the documentation is in error, or you can think of better ways to construct the models that I did. I will update when I can but I do have a lot going on.

I'm making these files available under a creative commons license. In a few cases, some of the materials in this repository were made available on blender swap under their own creative commons license. I am including the names of those people who made the materials. If anyone else would like to contribute something, I will list their names as well. If I included something in error, please let me know.

ESTABLISHING SHOTS

I include what I refer to as establishing shots to help keep the contents of all these files straight. They include images of the models from several angles, along with written notes right onto the image. The establishing shots are made by GIMP, a software tool available in Linux. I usually include the original gimp file in the work files directory, while the establishing shots are kept in the /images/establishing shots directory.

FILE DIRECTORY

I'm attempting to use a consistent file structure to make it easy to find objects. 

I use a very modular building style, meaning that rather then just including finished objects, I save the parts of the objects that I made along the way. This makes it easier to build similar objects, and it also makes it easier to edit the object you have. I keep all of the modules in the modules directory, while finished objects put together by those modules are in the modules directory.

The image directory divides up images. UV maps tend to be specific maps, while textures are images that might be reused many times. 

Styles are files that are generally used to link to when creating a style, usually nodes.

Scene blends are the ones I start with when creating an episode. I link or append into them, and an entire scene should be available.

SUPPORTING HOLODECK

I will soon be starting a patreon account. If you appreciate what I'm making available here and would like to make it possible for me to improve this service, please drop by and donate.

THE VIEW FROM SPACE

Almost all of the blends here were created to help me illustrate the View from Space. I will include a link here later.
